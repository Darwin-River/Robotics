# Welcome
This is the digital workshop for Tournament Robotics.  Please feel free to browse the content. 

My goal in creating this is to publish games in which players build and program robots that compete with one another in a well defined challenge.

## Design objectives
* Use the minimum number of parts.
* Provide standardized banner holders.
* Make it easy to break down and reuse the parts from old robots.
* Minimize construction costs.
* Minimize construction time.
* All robots can be constructed and programmed from instruction in a book.

## Chellenge ideas
* Line Racers. Two robots race to get to the end of a winding path and back.
* Sumo Boats. Paddle boats need to push each other out of the arena.
* Supercomputers. Efficiently code parallel Arduinos to quickly solve a mathematical problem.

Be sure to check out the [Code Library](/Code_Library) for useful C++ classes.
