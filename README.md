# Welcome
This is the digital workshop for Tournament Robotics. 

My goal in creating this is to publish games in which players build and program robots that compete with one another in a well defined challenge.

## Design objectives
* Use the minimum number of parts.
* Provide standardized banner holders.
* Make it easy to break down and reuse the parts from old robots.
* Minimize construction costs.
* Minimize construction time.
* All robots can be constructed and programmed from instruction in a book.
