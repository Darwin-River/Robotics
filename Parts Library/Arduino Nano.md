The Arduino Nano is a small, versatile, and highly affordable microcontroller board, which is based on the ATmega328P microprocessor.  The Nano is similar to the Arduino Uno but contained on a much smaller circuit board, making it ideal for use in compact applications.

As with the Arduino Uno, the Nano  has 14 digital input/output pins and 8 analog inputs, which make it suitable for use in a wide range of projects. 

The digital input/output pins are numbered from 0 to 13 and are capable of receiving a digital digital signal from an external sensor or sending a digital command to an output device such as an LED or servo motor.

Six of the digital pins are capable of emitting a pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage (ranging from 0 to 5 v) to an external circuit.  PWM output is available on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 and are prefixed with a tilde on the Nano’s printed circuit board.

The six analog inputs are labeled A0 through A7. These pins can read analog voltages between 0 and 5 volts and can also be used as digital input or output pins.  

The Nano can be powered and programmed via a USB connector.  However, it also has a power jack, which can accept a range of voltages, from 7 to 12 volts. The recommended voltage is 7-9 volts. The maximum current draw is 500 milliamps.

The open source Arduino Nano boards are available from a range of suppliers for under $10 each.
