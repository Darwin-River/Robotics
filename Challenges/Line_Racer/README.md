Line Racer is the first of the Tournament Robotics challenge robots that I'll be designing.  In this challenge,  students must program a robot to follow a curving line from beginning to end in a minimal amount of time.

The Line Racer Track is constructed by laying out black painter's tape on a white surface according to a set of rules that are described in that section.

The tournament rules are detailed under in the Line Racer Rules.

The robot itself consists of two servo-powered wheels, a pair of line-tracking IR sensors, and a microphone, which allows the robot to hear the starting whistle.  All of the robot's components are detailed in the Line Racer Parts.

The 3D printed Line Racer Chassis consists of a single block that holds all of the parts.
