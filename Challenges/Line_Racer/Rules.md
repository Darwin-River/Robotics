Line Racer tournaments feature identical dual-drive robots that use downward facing IR sensors to follow a twisting black line to its end and back. 

Each robot runs on its own uniquely-configured track.  However, the length of each track and its individual segments, as well as the number of turns are identical so that neither robot will have an unfair advantage.

To further ensure equity, programs from competing teams will be applied to randomly selected robots and race tracks during each of five one-on-one races. The fastest robot in three out of five races will win the match and proceed to the next round.

The challenge for participants will be to code a robot that efficiently follows the randomly configured Line Racer Track and confidently retraces its path to be the first across the finish line.   

At the start of the race, load each team’s binary code onto one of the robot and place the robot on a track so that it’s facing parallel to the line with its wheels straddling the end of the line and its IR sensor centered over the line.

Each robot must automatically start when a whistle is blown and follow its track to the far end and back without ever entirely leaving the track.

If a robot leaves the track so that none of its parts are located over the track, it will be disqualified from the race.

The first robot to successfully reach the end of the track and return to the starting point without being disqualified will win the race.

The first robot to win three races wins the match and advances to the next round.
