# Line Racers
In this game, line-following robots will race to the ends of twisting lines and return, possibly with a block in tow.

# Robot design
* Two drive wheels with a ball to complete the tripod.
* Two downward ficaing light sensors to use for following the line.
* A mic to hear the start signal -- generally someone blowing a whistle or clapping hands.
* An Arduino nano with IO shield
* 4 AA batteries

# Tournament rules
* Bots start at the opposite ends of a symetric maze.
* The start and finish of the cource will be marked with T intersections.
* With a clap or whistle sound they start racing to the other end of the curving path.
* When they reach a T intersection at they will reverse direction and return the way they came.
* Bots will reverse direction a predertermined number of times per the rules of the specific race.
