# Line Racers
In this game, line-following robots will race to the ends of twisting lines and return, possibly with a block in tow.

# Robot design
* Two drive wheels with a ball to complete the tripod.
* Two downward ficaing light sensors to use for following the line.
* A mic to hear the start signal -- generally someone blowing a whistle or clapping hands.
* An Arduino nano with IO shield
* 4 AA batteries

# Tournament rules
* Each bot races on a circular path with various twists and turns.
* All turns are at right angles.
* The starting point and lap marker is indicated by a double-thick line crossing the path.
* The robot must race around the track a set number of times.
* The direction the robot races is chosen randomly by flipping a coin.
