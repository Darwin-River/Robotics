# The Line Racer Challenge
As I mentioned in my previous video, I’m planning to create a series of robotic challenges in which students use 3D printed components and standardized Arduino parts to assemble and test robotic devices in their own homes and classrooms. 

In an iterative process, participants will share, test, and improve upon each other’s code using standardized robots.

I’ve decided to develop a simple line-racer robot for the first challenge.

I expect that this robot will consist of two servo-powered wheels mounted on either side of a square, 3D printed chassis.

The servos will be operated by an [[Arduino Nano]] controller as the robot attempts to follow a black line using infrared sensors.

Although the race course can be arranged in many different configurations, the overall length and number of turns will remain the same from one track to the next.

Robots will be evaluated and ranked based on the average time it takes them to make it to the end.

Students who participate in the competition will be challenged to develop novel routines that allow their robot to quickly complete the race.

I recently drafted an introductory section for the Line Racer competition that describes the rules and objectives for the challenge course.

The draft is currently available to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tournamentrobotics) sponsors but will eventually become part of the published manual.

I hope you'll continue to follow this channel as I order, assemble, and test the parts that are needed for a prototype robot.
