# Migrating to Obsidian
Hi! My name is Dave and I'm designing a series of robotic challenges that are intended to help students develop their coding and problem solving skills.

While working on this project, I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a highly versatile wiki and note taking system that allows its users to assemble a network of linked pages and post them online.  

Since then, I've become convinced that Obsidian the is an ideal platform for me to use when developing and sharing the robotic challenges and associated content with my sponsors.

Therefore, I've begun to transfer all the material that I had originally posted on Google Drive over to Obsidian.

I've also created a separate Patreon post, which tells my sponsors how to access the password protected site.  

So, if you're already a sponsor, or would like to become one, follow the link under this video to gain full access to my plans, programs, and design notes.

As mentioned in a previous video, I plan to post frequent updates on my progress. However,  going forward, I'll also be capturing these details on my [Obsidian website](https://publish.obsidian.md/tournamentrobotics) for those who are interested learning more about this project and applying it in their own classrooms.
