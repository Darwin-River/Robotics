# Introducing Tournament Robotics
Hello. My name is Dave and my goal is to develop and publish a set of well-defined robotic challenges that give students a chance to learn and explore creative coding solutions via an interactive online community.

The availability of 3D printing technologies and standardized Arduino parts means that students in many parts of the world can easily construct functionally identical devices on which to collaboratively develop, test, and share innovative coding solutions with one another.

I plan to structure this experience as a series of virtual competitions in which individuals are invited to construct standardized robots in their homes and classrooms and publish code that improves the device’s performance against well defined metrics.

As part of an iterative conversation, participants will test each other’s code on identically constructed platforms and counter with new or revised versions of the script, which attempt to out-perform earlier solutions.

During this process, students will have opportunities to learn from and build upon the solutions presented by their peers in different parts of the world.

As I develop and test the ideas for these robotic challenges, I’ll post weekly videos that describe my progress and share drafts of the emerging designs with my Patreon sponsors.

I’m hoping the feedback and support I receive from students and educators will help me perfect competition rules and allow individuals and classrooms to easily and affordably participate in international robotic challenges.

So please subscribe and follow along as I develop and post on the weekly progress of this project.
