Each Line Racer course will be constructed by cutting five  20 cm and three 15 cm strips of 20 mm thick black painter’s tape and joining the together in a continuous line such that:

1. Pieces of tape join at right angles to one another with both ends completely overlapping;
    
2. All segments are used in creating a continuous linear track that does not form any closed loops; and
    
3. The track is laid out over a level, light colored surface to contrast with the black tape.
